README = 'This is the gem5 simulator.\n\nFor detailed information about building the simulator and getting\nstarted please refer to:\n* The main website:     http://www.gem5.org\n* Documentation wiki:   http://www.gem5.org/Documentation \n* Doxygen generated:    http://www.gem5.org/docs\n* Tutorials:            http://www.gem5.org/Tutorials\n\n\nSpecific pages of interest are:\nhttp://www.gem5.org/Introduction\nhttp://www.gem5.org/Build_System\nhttp://www.gem5.org/Dependencies\nhttp://www.gem5.org/Running_gem5\n\nShort version:\nExternal tools and required versions\n\nTo build gem5, you will need the following software:\ng++ version 4.3 or newer.\nPython, version 2.4 - 2.7 (we don\'t support Python 3.X). gem5 links in the \n    Python interpreter, so you need the Python header files and shared \n    library (e.g., /usr/lib/libpython2.4.so) in addition to the interpreter\n    executable. These may or may not be installed by default. For example,\n    on Debian/Ubuntu, you need the "python-dev" package in addition to the\n    "python" package. If you need a newer or different Python installation\n     but can\'t or don\'t want to upgrade the default Python on your system,\n     see http://www.gem5.org/Using_a_non-default_Python_installation\nSCons, version 0.98.1 or newer. SCons is a powerful replacement for make. \n    If you don\'t have administrator privileges on your machine, you can use the\n    "scons-local" package to install scons in your m5 directory, or install SCons\n    in your home directory using the \'--prefix=\' option.  \nSWIG, version 1.3.34 or newer\nzlib, any recent version. For Debian/Ubuntu, you will need the "zlib-dev" or\n    "zlib1g-dev" package to get the zlib.h header file as well as the library\n    itself.\nm4, the macro processor.\n\n\n4. In this directory, type \'scons build/<ARCH>/gem5.opt\' where ARCH is one\nof ALPHA, ARM, MIPS, POWER, SPARC, or X86. This will build an optimized version\nof the gem5 binary (gem5.opt) for the the specified architecture.\n\nIf you have questions, please send mail to gem5-users@gem5.org\n\nWHAT\'S INCLUDED (AND NOT)\n-------------------------\n\nThe basic source release includes these subdirectories:\n - gem5:\n   - configs: example simulation configuration scripts\n   - ext: less-common external packages needed to build gem5\n   - src: source code of the gem5 simulator\n   - system: source for some optional system software for simulated systems\n   - tests: regression tests\n   - util: useful utility programs and files\n\nTo run full-system simulations, you will need compiled system firmware\n(console and PALcode for Alpha), kernel binaries and one or more disk images. \nPlease see the gem5 download page for these items at http://www.gem5.org/Download \n'
